# CMSC828I-Advanced-Techniques-in-Visual-Learning-Recognition
This repository serves as a record of my academic experience in CMSC828 during the Fall of 2023. It includes my code submissions for assignments and projects. Each assignment is organized within its respective folder, complete with accompanying documentation and any necessary resources.

## ðŸ“š Course Overview
The "Advanced Techniques in Visual Learning & Recognition" (CMSC828I - Fall 2021) course at the University of Maryland offers a deep dive into the cutting-edge realms of computer vision and high-level recognition tasks. This course is structured into five key modules, each addressing a crucial aspect of visual learning and recognition:

1. **Background and Foundations:** Introduction to Data, covering topics like the massive 80 million tiny image dataset and the storage capacity of visual long-term memory. Data-driven methods in vision, including image restoration, scene completion, and geographic information estimation from images. Exploring ConvNets and architectures, with a focus on various important architectures and the inner workings of convolutional neural networks.

2. **Core Tasks:** Foundational topics in Object Detection and Image Segmentation, including Histograms of Oriented Gradients and object detection with part-based models. Single-stage object detection techniques like OverFeat, SSD, and YOLO, as well as semantic segmentation methods. Multi-stage object detection and instance segmentation using approaches like Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and Mask R-CNN. Introduction to transformers for detection/segmentation. Analysis, diagnosis, and training strategies for object detectors.

4. **Additional Topics:** Introduction to other tasks like Human Pose Estimation. Guest lecture on Reinforcement Learning. Self-supervised Learning. Learned Compression techniques beyond images and video. Neural Architecture Search for efficient model design. Vision Techniques for Reinforcement Learning. Action Recognition methods. Attribute recognition. Context reasoning in object recognition.

5. **Guest Lectures:** Guest lectures covering topics like self-supervised learning, learned compression, neural architecture search, vision techniques for reinforcement learning, action recognition, attributes, and context reasoning.

6. **Generative Models and More:** In-depth exploration of 3D Scene Understanding, Primitives, and Reasoning. Study of 3D object recognition, including 3D Scene Understanding, 3D object primitives, and reasoning. Generative Models for image and data generation. Miscellaneous topics related to visual data mining and discovery. Ethical considerations in computer vision.

Throughout the course, students will engage with a wide range of research papers, lectures, and assignments, providing them with a comprehensive understanding of advanced techniques in visual learning and recognition. The course covers foundational concepts, cutting-edge methods, and emerging trends in the field of computer vision and visual recognition.

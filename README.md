# CMSC828I-Advanced-Techniques-in-Visual-Learning-Recognition
This repository serves as a record of my academic experience in CMSC828 during the Fall of 2023. It includes my code submissions for assignments and projects. Each assignment is organized within its respective folder, complete with accompanying documentation and any necessary resources.

## üìö Course Overview
The "Advanced Techniques in Visual Learning & Recognition" (CMSC828I - Fall 2021) course at the University of Maryland offers a deep dive into the cutting-edge realms of computer vision and high-level recognition tasks. This course is structured into five key modules, each addressing a crucial aspect of visual learning and recognition:

1. **Background and Foundations:** In this initial module, we establish a strong foundation by delving into the historical evolution of computer vision sub-topics. We'll explore state-of-the-art methodologies and tackle the challenges that demand attention. Topics include data-driven methods, the effectiveness of data, and unbiased dataset analysis.

2. **Core Tasks:** The second module centers around core computer vision tasks, specifically object detection and image segmentation. We'll cover both foundational and advanced approaches in these areas, from Histograms of Oriented Gradients to the latest transformers and architectures.

3. **Additional Topics:** Moving beyond the core tasks, this module introduces students to a range of advanced topics. These include human pose estimation, reinforcement learning, self-supervised learning, and generative models, all within the context of computer vision.

4. **Guest Lectures:** Our course features insights from experts in the field through guest lectures. Topics include self-supervised learning, learned compression beyond images and video, neural architecture search, vision techniques for reinforcement learning, action recognition, attributes, and context reasoning.

5. **Generative Models and More:** In the final module, we explore generative models in depth, covering GANs and VAEs. We also delve into miscellaneous topics, providing students with a broader perspective on visual data mining and discovery.

Throughout the course, we aim to empower students with the skills to critically evaluate research, make connections between different works, and engage in productive discussions. By the end of this course, you will be well-equipped to navigate the intricate world of advanced techniques in visual learning and recognition.
